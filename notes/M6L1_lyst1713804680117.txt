JENKINS
----------------------
=> Jenkins is an Open-Source automation tool for CI & CD.

=> Jenkins is built on Java-11 software.

CI = Continuous Build + Continuous Test

CD ---> Continuous Delivery --->  Deploying the code manually to the Production Environment
CD ---> Continuous Deployment --->  Deploying the code automatically to the Production Environment

In order to automate the deployment of code into the servers we will use JENKINS tool.

=> In Jenkins we will work with Jobs (Jenkins Jobs)

Ex: Code ---> GitHub ---> Build (Maven) ---> Test ---> Deploy

=> Pipeline: To create CI&CD, we will create Jenkins Pipelines

Pipeline is a step by step execution a particular job

=> Code ---> Build ---> Test ---> Deploy = Pipeline

=> Pipeline is actually a series of events interlinked with eachother.

Environments:
--------------------
1. Dev - Developers uses this
2. QA - Testing team will use this
3. UAT - Client will use this
4. Prod - End users will use this

Build and Deployment Process
---------------------------------------
1. Take the latest code from Repo.
2. Compile the source code
3. Execute the unit testing 
4. Perform code review
5. Package the code (war file)
6. Deploy the war file into the servers (EC2 Instances)

All the above steps can be automated using Jenkins tool.
