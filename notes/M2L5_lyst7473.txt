9. How to create files in linux OS?
=> In linux OS we can create files in 3 ways;
	1. touch
	2. cat
	3. vi

9.1 How to create an empty file?
$ touch <file-name>

9.2 How to create a file with some content inside it?
$ cat > <file-name>
It will ask you to enter the data inside the file. Enter some data. 
Once after writing the data inside the file, to comeout/exit, use "control+d"

Note: If file name is not available, Linux will create that file in the backend and allows us to write the content inside it.

9.3 How to see the content in a specific file?
$ cat <file-name>

Note: Touch is used to create an empty file.
	  Cat is used to create a file with some content inside it.

10. How to write the additional content inside an existing file?
$ cat > <file-name>
Note: It will delete the old data and will display only the latest data.
10.1 In real-time, we need to protect the old data, by writing the new data.
$ cat >> <file-name>

Note: If you give one > symbol, it will erase the old data and gets replaced with new data.
	 If you give two >> symbols, it will protect the old data and also allows us to write the new data, as well.

11. How to remove a file?
$ rm <file-name>

12. If you want to display the list of files based on timestamp (latest to oldest)
$ ls -lt

13. If you want to display the list of files based on timestamp (oldest to latest)
$ ls -lr

Note: By default, when we give ls -l, it will print the files in alphabetical order.

14. To print the content of a particular directory
$ ls -l <directory name>

15. How to remove a directory?
=> If the directory is empty, we can delete that directory using "rmdir <directory-name>"

=> If the directory is not empty, and if you want to delete the files inside a directory along with the directory itself, then
rm -r <directory-name>

16. How to rename a file or a directory?
=> mv command is used to rename a file/directory
Syntax: mv <name of the file you want to change> <modified name>
Ex: mv aws.txt devops.txt
Note: To move the files from one directory to another directory, we can use "mv" command.

17. How to copy the data from one file to another file?
=> Ex: aws.txt (AWS is having 250+ services)
		devops.txt
Syntax: cat <file1 name> > <file2 name>
Ex: cat aws.txt > devops.txt

Note: If File 2 is not available, it will create the file2 and then copies the content from file 1

18. How to copy the data from 2 files to a third file?
Syntax: cat <file1> <file2> > <file3>

19. How to create a copy of a file?
Syntax: cp <file1> <file2>
Note: "cp" is used only for one file
	"cat" is used for copying the content from multiple files to a single file

20. How to move a file from one directory to another directory?
Syntax: mv <path> <path>
